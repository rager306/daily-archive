# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Rust v2 (2026-07-26)

- **Architecture guardrail CI rewritten** for Rust hexagonal layout (D131).
  Old Python M044/M045 workflow was broken after Python→legacy move
  (`scripts/` and root `pyproject.toml` gone). New workflow: cargo fmt/check/clippy
  + dependency-direction check. Local mirror: `scripts/verify_rust_architecture.sh`.
- **Pre-commit restored**: `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with cargo-fmt + cargo-check
  (was missing; every commit required `PRE_COMMIT_ALLOW_NO_CONFIG=1`).
- **cargo fmt** applied across all crates; unused imports cleaned.
- `da load-snapshot` + `da graph-stats` CLI commands (snapshot round-trip).
- `da batch-ingest` with `.sgsnap` export (Solution B durability).
- GROBID title extraction bug fixed (TEI attributes).
- `da-graph` filled: Cypher query builders + schema DDL (8 unit tests).
- Integration tests for batch_ingest with mock ports (5 tests, no live services).
- ADR-INDEX.md + ADR-037 status marked partially superseded by 040/041.
- README rewritten for Rust v2 (was fully Python-era).

### Hygiene (earlier)

- Remove obsolete root briefs and empty `Plans/`.
- Document local garbage policy (`doc/REPO-HYGIENE.md`).

### ETL / Wave B (frozen under legacy/)

- M271–M284: quality n-contract, hybrid bodies, import-hold inventory, evidence chain.
- Import remains locked (D127); deploy extract path remains `header_priority`.
- Full Python stack frozen under `legacy/` — not on the Rust runtime path.

## Earlier history

Milestone-level detail lives in git history and GSD phase summaries. Prefer:

- `doc/adr/ADR-INDEX.md` for binding architecture decisions
- `doc/PERSISTENCE-ANALYSIS.md` for graph durability model
- `artifacts/etl/` for historical Python ETL evidence
